# Browser Extension

## How to setup?

- Install the dependencies by running

  ```
    yarn install
  ```

- Start the development server (Keep running to build on change)

  ```
    yarn dev
  ```

- Open up `chrome://extensions` and load the `build` folder

Note: One would have to turn on developer options to load an unpacked extension.
